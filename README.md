# NoWires
Wireless 3D printing Web Application
####Objective
This is a project that can be seen as an extension of Octoprint. Octorint is a tool that allows a user to wirelessly print using an easy and simple web interface. The problem with Octoprint is it does not allow for control of multiple 3D printers. Thus I introduce you to OctoFarm. OctoFarm is a neatly packaged web interface that builds upon Octoprint to provide support for controlling multiple printers at many different remote locations. 
####Solution
This project will solve that problem by allowing users to add multiple printers to the server therefore those printers can now be fully control through the internet via web-interface and application from anywhere that has internet access.
