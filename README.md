Wireless 3D printing Web Application
###Objective
The objective of this project is to be able to solve the hassle of having to physically be next to your 3d printer and plugged into the computer. This will allow you to control only local 3d printers.  
###Solution
This project will solve that problem by allowing users to add multiple printers to the server therefore those printers can now be fully control through the internet via web-interface and application from anywhere that has internet access.
